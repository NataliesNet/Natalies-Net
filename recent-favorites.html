        <h2>Faves Entry #1</h2>
		<p>Monday February 7, 2022</p>
		<p>Last night I watched the recent episode of Euphoria with Lauren, Sab, Leni, and Maisie! Euphoria is obviously a recent fave, but this episode in particular brought out the strengths of the show. The whole episode followed Rue and it definitely highlighted Zendaya's (Z's) talent. The whole hour was so tense, I had a stomach ache by the end.</p>
        <p>Also, Alexa Demie was amazing. As always.</p>
